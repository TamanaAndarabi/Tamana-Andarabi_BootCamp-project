                          Restarting education is a priority for the Afghan government.There were a few leaders how were able to make some changes,Among them was King Amanullah how made some changes in an attempt to modernize the country.One of their main goals was to provide formal education for girls in areas where access to education has been denied to them in the past. Women's higher education has been greatly affected in recent decades.Women gained access to higher education in the 1950s, and by the early 1990s, women accounted for almost 40%. The Taliban government revolutionized the development. Girls were barred from attending school by the Taliban.But now, with the establishment of an independent Islamic government in Afghanistan, the majority of women can continue their studies in schools and universities.
