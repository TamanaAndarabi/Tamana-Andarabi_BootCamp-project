                 				  Women's right in Afghanistan have been varied throughout history.Women right's were taken away in the 1990s through temporary rulers such as the Taliban during war.Especialy during the latter's rule,women had very little to no freedom,specificaly in
                          term of Taliban.Since the Taliban regime was removed in 2001,women's rights have gradually improved under the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan.However,their rights are still complicated by a reactionary view on women bycertain classes of school,particularly ruralites which continue to cause international concern.A large number of Afghan women serve as members of parliament.Some of these included Shukria Barakzai,Fauzia Koofi,Nilofar Ibrahimi and Malali Joya.Several women also took positionasministars, including Suhaila Seddiqi,Sima Samar,Husn Bano Ghazanfar,and Suraya Dalil.And also Habiba Sarabi became the first governor women in Afghanistan.
